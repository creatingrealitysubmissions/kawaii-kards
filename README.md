Thanks for visiting our Github page! Unfortunately we weren't too familiar with submission on Github using Unity,
so for the first commits we exported the package and saved it in different folders. Right now most of the files 
from our Unity project is up, so enjoy!

Look for our scripts under the Build folder, which include ScoreManager.cs and SoundManager.cs (note that these scripts 
were originally just under the Build folder, but were moved to the Scripts folder later on)
